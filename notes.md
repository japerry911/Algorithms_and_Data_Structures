# Binary Search Trees

- Insertion, Searching, Deletion
  - Average Space Time Complexities
    - Time => O(log(n))
    - Space =>
      - recursively - O(log(n))
      - iteratively - O(1)
  - Worst Space Time Complexities
    - Time => O(n)
      - no left or right nodes
    - Space =>
      - recursively - O(n)
      - iteratively - O(1)
