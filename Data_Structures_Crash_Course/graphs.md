- graphs are made up of vertices and edges
  - edges - arrows that connect vertices (nodes) together
    - one direction per edge
  - vertices - nodes that may have values (example: integer values)
- a collection of nodes that may or may not be connected to each other
- graph is connected - say this if you can reach any node in the graph
- edges are represented by arrows pointing one way, or both if the arrow is pointing both ways
- directed graph - pointed one way
  - airplane flying to destination
- undirected graph - pointing both ways
  - Facebook friendship
- cycle - 3 or more nodes that go in an infinite loop/cycle
  - cyclic graph
    - Wikipage that links from graphs -> data structures -> time/space complexities -> back to graphs
      - cycles back to graphs
- depth-first search - deep first, then wider
- breadth-first search - wider first, then deep
- both have have Time/Space Complexities of O(V + E) => O(Vertices + Edges)
