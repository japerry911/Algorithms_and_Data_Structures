- stored values in memory don't have to be back to back, they can be anywhere in memory
- structure/item in linked list => node
- node
  - one memory slot holds value, other memory slot holds the pointer
    - back to back memory slots
    - pointer that points to null address => nullptr
- get operation
  - O(n) T
  - O(1) S
- set operation
  - O(n) T
  - O(1) S
- initialize operation
  - O(n) ST
- copy operation
  - O(n) ST
- traverse operation
  - O(n) T
  - O(1) S
- insert operation
  - O(1)
- delete operation
  - O(1)
- singly and doubly linked lists
  - singly
    - only has next pointer
  - doubly
    - has next and previous pointers
