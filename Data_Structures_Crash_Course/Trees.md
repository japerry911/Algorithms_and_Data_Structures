- node can only have one parent
- binary tree => at most each has 2 child nodes (can have 1 or 0 child nodes)
- binary search tree - BST
- storing -> O(n) S
- traverse - O(n) T
- removing - grabbing smallest node value in the right subtree and have it replaced removed node
  - in other words, left mode node value in the right subtree
